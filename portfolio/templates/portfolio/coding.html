      I never had such an appreciation for this area, until I had the
      opportunity to study it at school. I couldn't, but I continued dedicating
      myself to self-taught studies at home. <br />
      I currently have a lot of appreciation for JavaScript and Python, and I'm
      training to become a Fullstack developer.

      Here I will leave some of my projects. I was unable to deploy most of the
      larger projects, so they are only available to be viewed via video :(
      <br />
      However, I still intend to learn and play it on the web for everyone to
      see, and to replace it, I will leave my Linkedin link so you can see the
      project.
